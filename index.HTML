        <h2>Elephant</h2>Elephants are majestic and intelligent animals, known for their massive size and distinctive trunks. There are three
        species: the African savanna elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are social creatures,
        often forming close-knit herds led by a matriarch, and they have complex communication methods, including vocalizations
        and even low-frequency sounds that can travel long distances.
        Elephants are herbivores, consuming vast amounts of vegetation daily, and their impressive memory contributes to their
        survival, particularly in finding water sources during droughts.

    <h2>Deer</h2>
    Deer are herbivorous mammals belonging to the Cervidae family, found in diverse habitats across the globe, except
    Antarctica. Known for their antlers, which males regrow annually, they come in various species such as white-tailed
    deer, red deer, and reindeer. They are agile and have excellent senses of smell, hearing, and vision, which help them
    detect predators. Social by nature, many deer species form herds, especially during mating or migration seasons. Deer
    play a vital ecological role by influencing plant growth and aiding seed dispersal through grazing.

        <h2>Giraffe</h2>
        Giraffes are the tallest land animals, known for their long necks, spotted coats, and gentle demeanor. Native to Africa,
        they feed on leaves from tall trees like acacias. Their necks and long legs help them reach high vegetation, while their
        unique coat patterns provide camouflage. Giraffes live in loose social groups and communicate through vocalizations and
        body language. They play an important role in their ecosystem by aiding in seed dispersal.
